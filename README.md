# Noto CJK "Pinned" Fonts

A locale‑agnostic fork of Noto CJK typeface that locks each Unified Han glyph to a single regional design, guaranteeing pixel‑perfect consistency no matter the user’s language settings and full character coverage at the same time.

## Why another Noto?

Noto CJK fonts only ship with two types:
- Full character coverage **and** language-tagged glyphs
- Region-specific subset with **limited character coverage**

Noto CJK "Pinned" is designed to fill in this gap: to offer a font with full character coverage **and** a deterministic region-specific style.

Possible use case would be to use in software with language tagging feature that could be potentially against the user's preferences, such as default font for browsers.
